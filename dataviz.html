      <h4>About this project</h4>
        <p><em>Deepest gratitute to <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/robocop-on-a-unicorn">Olav Rokne</a>, award-winning tweetwright, photographer extraordinare, dedicated fan researcher and writer, and good friend. This project was only possible with his data and generosity.</em></p>
        <p>This project is about looking at the basic demographics of first time <a href="http://www.thehugoawards.org/about/">Hugo Award</a> fiction winners - primarily <strong>gender</strong> and <strong>category</strong>. More specifically: which category seems to be the most equal between the genders.</p>
      </p>In this project, I divided gender into three categories: Female, Male, and Nonbinary. Because transwomen are women and transmen are men, this means they are in their respective categories. It also meant checking for pseudynoms. If it hadn't been for a late-night dive into the Michael Moorcock versus Robert Heinlein <a href="https://libcom.org/library/starship-stormtroopers-michael-moorcock">politics of science fiction debate</a> and associated rabbit-hole reading, I might have missed that James Tiptree Jr. was the pen name for <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6468136">Alice Bradley Sheldon</a>. It's also notable that I could not find any nonbinary winners in these four categories–– a fact that I hope becomes out of date sooner than later.</p>
        <p>While the Hugo Awards have numerous categories, the four "big" categories are given to written works of fiction: Novel (40,000 words or more), Novella (40,000 to 17,500 words), Novelette (17,500 to 7,500 words), and Short Story (less than 7,500). The associated numbers in this visualization are as follows: number of first time winners total of each category, number of winners by gender, number of total fiction wins by the individual. This means that while <a href="https://www.cityinthemiddleofthenight.com/">Charlie Jane Anders</a> has won Hugo Awards for her novelette <a href="https://www.tor.com/2011/06/08/six-months-three-days/">Six Months, Three Days</a> and for her podcast <a href="https://www.ouropinionsarecorrect.com/">Our Opinions are Correct</a> (shared with Annalee Newitz), she is only counted with one win as the Fancast category is not one analyzed by this project.</p>
